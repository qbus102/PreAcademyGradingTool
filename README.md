Basic steps of making my application:
1. Creating a holder for data PreAcademyStudent record with tests
2. Creating a sorting class GradingSystem using Comparators
3. Creating executing class CourseRanking with hardcoded
 input of students data from a csv file and console-chosen method of sorting

Main things I think should be improved:
 - write tests
 - move File operating to another package
 - change the hardcoded input - input parameters should be added from terminal when program is runned
